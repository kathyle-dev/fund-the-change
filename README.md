# Fund The Change: 2020b Full Stack App

#### Project Scope: Create a Full Stack Application that will help the community. We chose to make an application that makes donating to nonprofits and grass-roots organizations easier. Users can create an account, search for organizations in our database, donate to organizations of their choice with a click of a button via the Stripe API, and favorite those organizations so they can easily donate to them again when they log in.
